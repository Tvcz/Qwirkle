# Qwirkle

An implementation of Qwirkle in TypeScript that uses a server-client TCP commmunication protocol for multiplayer play and features a graphical user view developed using Electron.

Source code can be found in the `Q` folder. The other folders contain scenarios for integration testing.

Developed alongside several students over the course of the Fall 2023 Semester for my Software Development class.
